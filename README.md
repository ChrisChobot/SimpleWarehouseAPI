# SimpleWarehouseAPI

Hi!

This project is about to show simple webAPI made in .NET core 2.0
Data is stored by MSSQL, ORM is EF core 2.1.11. I have used code first approach on this project.

Tests are executing on NUnit framework, and DB used for them is made by EF.InMemory.

Usage of this WebAPI you can found in Index.cshtml
